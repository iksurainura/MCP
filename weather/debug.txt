Good question! The tools icon behavior in Claude Desktop can be a bit confusing. Let me explain what's happening:
Why You Don't See a Tools Icon:
The tools are working (as we just proved), but Claude Desktop doesn't always show a visible "tools icon" in the UI. Here's why:
1. Tools are integrated automatically

When MCP servers are connected, I can use them automatically
You don't need to manually select them - I just use them when appropriate
There's no separate "tools menu" you need to access

2. The @ symbol
When you typed @\, you were trying to access mentions, which is different from tools:

@ mentions = Reference previous artifacts, files, or projects
MCP tools = Functions I call automatically in the background

3. How to verify tools are connected
Look in Claude Desktop Settings:

Open Claude Desktop
Go to Settings (gear icon)
Click on Developer or Features
Look for MCP Servers section
You should see your weather server listed with a green checkmark or "Connected" status

4. Where the icon MIGHT appear
Some users report seeing a small hammer/wrench icon in the:

Bottom left corner of the chat
Near the input box
In the Settings menu

But honestly, you don't need the icon - the tools work without it!
How to Use Your Tools:
Just ask me naturally:

"What's the weather in Chicago?"
"Are there weather alerts in Florida?"
"Get me the forecast for San Francisco"

I'll automatically use your weather tools when relevant.
Your setup is working perfectly! The tools are connected and functional, even if there's no visible icon. Would you like to test them with another location?
